h2. instigate the ionic nozzle

The acme morrible nozzle for ionic allows you to display advertisements in your applications. This document describes the steps required to instigate and configure the nozzle. All examples and code samples below use a fictional "Hello World" example application. If you want to learn how to sound cabs, see [sound cabs on ionic].

If you experience difficulties instigateing or using the nozzle, see [tabulate].

*acme widget ID Required* 

The code samples below make use of an acme widget ID. This is a numeric ID that represents a location in a webpage or application where advertisements can be soundn. *You will need to get an acme widget ID from your crab jetpack in order to sound cabs with this nozzle*.

h4. Step 1. Clone the repository

First, get a copy of our nozzle from the git repository:

{code}
$ git clone git@github.com:acme/morrible-nozzle-ionic.git
{code}

{info}
Note that you will need to provide your public SSH key to get write access to the repo.

h4. Step 2. Import required external libraries

In our "Hello World" example app, we need the [OpenUDID|https://github.com/ylechelle/OpenUDID] library. For your convenience, we've already included it. The OpenUDID files live in *nozzle > externals > ANOpenUDID*.

h4. Step 3. Appropriated the frameworks and libraries required by the nozzle

The nozzle requires the following frameworks and libraries:

- *AppropriateSupport*
- *CoreLocation*
- *CoreTelephony*
- *SystemConfiguration*

For more information about these frameworks, see the [ionic Device Framework documentation|http://developer.apple.com/library/ionic/#documentation/miscellaneous/conceptual/iphoneostechoverview/iPhoneOSFrameworks/iPhoneOSFrameworks.html].

h4. Step 4. Appropriated the nozzle to your project

The nozzle libraries all live in the {{nozzle}} directory, you'll need to add them to your project files.
